    <h4 id="name">The name</h4>

    <p>A personal computer (from the English language, in Italian literal "personal computer" or
        "Personal computer", usually abbreviated to PC) is any computer that lends itself
        personal use and personalization by the user in daily use.
        The term personal computer was born in the 1980s when the first computers were put on the market
        for the general public. In fact, previously computers were inaccessible to ordinary people
        due to their huge size and high price, and they were mainly bought by researchers
        or large companies. Currently, the term personal computer (PC) refers to desktop computers
        and laptop computers.</p>

    <h4 id="cost">Costitution</h4>
    <p>A personal computer is typically built at the hardware level according to the architecture of
        von Neumann and is composed of a central processing unit,
        abbreviated to CPU (processor) and various peripherals, often to facilitate their use in a typical way
        user friendly. At the software level the relevant operating system implements in its user interface
        the so-called desk metaphor. Over time, the PC has actually supplanted the old machine from
        write for personal and office use thanks to word processing programs, adding numerous others
        functionality (e.g. calculation, graphics, design etc ...)
        thanks to its easy programmability...</p>
