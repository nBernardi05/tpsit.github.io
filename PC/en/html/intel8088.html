    <p><small><em>(From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia)</em></small></p>
    <p>The Intel 8088 was a microprocessor manufactured by Intel. It came from the Intel 8086, with which
        it shared the internal 16-bit architecture and the 20-bit address bus, thanks to which it was able
        to address 1 MB of memory, but from which it differed in the data bus with only 8 bits
        (half of that of 8086).</p>
    <p>The first processor model was equipped with 29,000 transistors capable of operating at one frequency
        maximum of 5 MHz and small enough to allow the manufacture of a compact integrated from
        use in office or home computer. The Intel 8088 was chosen by IBM for its first PC, where
        it worked at 4.77 MHz. Subsequently the Intel 8088-2 was made capable of operating at 8 MHz,
        which was used on IBM compatibles where the presence of a "Turbo" button, contrary to
        as the name implies, it allowed to reduce the frequency to 4.77 MHz in order to perform
        correctly designed software for the previous generation of the processor. The latest models
        called 8088-1 reached speeds of 10 MHz. Like the 8086, the 8088 also supported the
        Intel 8087 math coprocessor.</p>
    <p>The bus pins of the 8088 transmit, depending on the processor's needs, data for the bus
        addresses (pins AD7-AD0 and A19-A8), for the memory and I / O data bus (pins AD7-AD0).
        In order to use the processor more simply, the bus is generally demultiplexed, that is, they come
        created separate buses for memory, I / O, and addresses. To do this, drivers are used
        bidirectional (or transceiver) for the I / O and memory buses and latch-CD for the address bus.
        This general solution is naturally adapted to the particular conditions. Additional signals
        of the 8088 communicate if the processor intends to receive or transmit data (DT / R * signal), access the
        memory or to I / O (IO / M * signal) and so on, thus allowing programming of the circuitry
        additional.</p>
    <p>The 8088 was designed for low-cost computers, which allowed the use of an 8-point design
        bit. The prefetch queue of the 8088 is 4 bytes, compared to 6 bytes of the 8086. The evolutions
        of 8088 were 80188, 80288 and 80388, which are still used today in some areas
        specific. Despite the introduction of later and far more advanced models,
        the 8088 went out of production only in September 2007 [citation needed]; it was no longer used
        as a PC processor since 1992, but in the industry he had found other interesting ones
        uses.</p>
    <p>A compatible replacement processor, the V20, was produced by NEC bearing a
        performance increase of approximately 20%.</p>
