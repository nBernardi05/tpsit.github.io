    <p>The following is a list of Intel Core i9 brand microprocessors. They were introduced in May 2017
        for LGA 2066 chips, also known as Intel Core X-series processors. With their high number of cores,
        high power draw, high thermal output, and high performance, they are intended to be used by
        enthusiasts. A mobile version based on the standard BGA1440 socket was released in 2018, featuring
        six hyperthreaded cores and 12 MB of cache. It has been proven to be able to attain 5 GHz under ideal
        conditions.</p>
        <p>The Core i9 brand was expanded to incorporate mainstream processors in October 2018,
            following the release of the Core i9-9900K processor, which uses Intel's mainstream consumer
            platform.</p>
