    <p>The MOS 6502 is an 8-bit microprocessor presented by MOS Technology in September 1975.</p>
    <p>Together with the Zilog Z80 from July 1976 it was used in many products that were later marketed
        of the seventies and eighties, such as arcade games and home consoles, personal and home
        computers, such as the Apple II and Commodore VIC-20. [1] It was produced under license by many companies,
        including Rockwell International and Synertek. Several processors derive from the MOS 6502, including si
        they include the MOS 6507, used in the Atari 2600 console, the MOS 6509, used in the computer line
        Commodore CBM, and the MOS 6510, used as the Commodore 64 CPU.</p>
